## About
This is a project to compile all race results in one place, in an easy-to-read and consistent format. I have attempted to be accurate, and follow most of the conventions from the FIA, but some have been changed (mainly in races not classified) to provide slightly more information. Currently, the race results are in plaintext and json, with everything else being plaintext only because I haven't figured out the format I want driver bios, team bios, and such yet. No API because fuck you. It is highly structured though so go crazy if you want to make your own.

## Terminology
Most terminology you'll see is standard language. The only planned differences are in races not classified.

## Contributing
If you discover an error in a document (wrong info, typo, misspelling, mismatch in expected format), open an Issue so it can be reviewed. If you would like to submit past races, open a pull request. Please note that only requests with both plaintext and JSON will be considered.
